To evaluate the **Fit Score** of a company, consider five key areas, totaling 40 points. Start with **Product/Service Alignment** (15 points), assessing how well the company’s needs match your offerings; high compatibility with your core functions scores full points. Next, examine **Strategic Partnership Potential** (10 points): companies that could enhance brand recognition or enable market expansion should score highly here. Assess **Technology and Innovation Orientation** (5 points), giving full points to companies invested in advanced tech or AI. **Growth Potential and Scalability** (5 points) reflects whether the company is expanding or actively hiring, suggesting future needs that could align with your solutions. Finally, consider **Financial Health and Resource Availability** (5 points), focusing on the company’s ability to invest in new solutions based on revenue or funding status. A score of 35–40 indicates an ideal fit and high outreach priority, while 25–34 suggests a strong but less urgent fit, 15–24 reflects a moderate fit, and below 15 indicates low priority. This approach ensures focus on leads with the greatest alignment and potential impact.
